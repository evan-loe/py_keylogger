# py_keylogger
I wanted to see how much I used the numpad and other keys such as function keys to determine the type of keyboard size I should get (ie TKL, 100%, 60% etc)

Only dependency is pynput which you can install using `pip install pynput`

You can run the script using `python ./keyboard/key_logging.py`
To exit and save, hold down the keys 'e' 'x' 'i' and 't'
